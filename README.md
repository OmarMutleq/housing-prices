## 📊 Project Overview

In this group project, we developed a predictive model for housing prices using a dataset of residential properties from Kaggle. Our analysis involved data cleaning, feature engineering, and stacking multiple regression models for enhanced performance.

**Key Techniques Used:**
- Data Cleaning & EDA (handling nulls, outliers, and skewness)
- Feature Engineering (composite features, ordinal/one-hot encoding)
- Regularized Linear Models (Lasso, Ridge)
- Ensemble Learning (XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Model Stacking
- 10-Fold Cross Validation

## 📈 Results

- **Best RMSE (CV, log-transformed):** 0.12278  
- **Final Model:** Stacked Regressor (Lasso + Ridge + XGBoost + LightGBM)
- **Ranking:** 🏅 **489 out of 4,675** — Top 11% on Kaggle leaderboard
